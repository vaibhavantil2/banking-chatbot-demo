This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the @papercups-io/chat-builder package in the parent directory for development purposes.

### Usage

```bash
# in parent/root (/) directory
npm install  # install deps for @papercups-io/chat-builder
# in example/current directory
npm install  # install @papercups-io/chat-builder and its dependencies from the parent
npm start    # serves the example app on :3000
```

Updates to functionality in the parent dir will be reflected in the example app.
